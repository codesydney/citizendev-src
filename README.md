### Citizen Developer (CitizenDev)

A citizen developer is a non-technical user who creates or customizes applications or solutions within their organization using low-code or no-code platforms. These platforms are designed to be user-friendly and require minimal programming knowledge, allowing individuals with limited technical expertise to build functional applications, automate processes, or develop solutions that meet specific needs.
