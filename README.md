Citizen Developer

A citizen developer is an employee who creates application capabilities for consumption by themselves or others, using tools that are not actively forbidden by IT or business units. A citizen developer is a persona, not a title or targeted role. They report to a business unit or function other than IT.

All citizen developers are business technologists.  However, all business technologists are not necessarily citizen developers.  There is no required designation of proficiency or time allocation for citizen developers but they must be legal employees of an organization.
